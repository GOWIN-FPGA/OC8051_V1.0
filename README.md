### Welcome to GOWIN's open source OC8051 project. 

The OC8051 microcontroller is a member of the MCS-51 series, originally designed by Intel in the 1980s. Since its launch, the 8051 has gained widespread popularity and continues to have significant market applications in low-end embedded systems.

The basic components of the 8051 microcontroller include multiple on-chip peripherals, such as I/O ports and timers/counters, as well as up to 256 bytes of on-chip data memory and up to 64KB of on-chip program memory.

As a soft-core microcontroller, the OC8051 overcomes the hardware limitations of the 8051 chip, allowing for the expansion of on-chip ROM and RAM space based on signal width to run larger program code. It also enables the separation of the P3 interface from external interrupt inputs and timer/counter inputs, allowing for independent operation and freeing up multiplexed pins.
